# Multimodal Fraud Detection

## Overview

**Multimodal Fraud Detection** is a machine learning project designed to classify messages as either **fraudulent** or **normal** using **both text and audio inputs**.  
The system combines a **speech-to-text (STT)** model, **emotion detection model**, and traditional **text-based ML classifiers** to detect fraudulent patterns, including scam calls, phishing attempts, and suspicious messages.

## Goals

- Integrate audio and text features into a unified multimodal pipeline.  
- Extract and leverage **audio characteristics** such as duration, pitch, and loudness.  
- Capture **emotional cues** from speech that indicate suspicious intent.  
- Provide a reproducible and interpretable model for multimodal fraud detection.  

## Demo

All data is **simulated or publicly available**. No real telecom or sensitive customer data is used.  
This project is for demonstration and research purposes only and is **not intended for deployment** in production environments.
